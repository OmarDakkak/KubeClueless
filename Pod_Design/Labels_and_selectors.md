# Labels and Selectors in Kubernetes

Labels and selectors are fundamental to organizing and selecting Kubernetes objects. They enable flexible and powerful ways to organize, query, and operate on groups of resources in your cluster.

## Labels

Labels are key-value pairs attached to Kubernetes objects that are used for organizing, categorizing, and selecting subsets of objects.

### Label Structure

Labels follow this format:
```
name: value
```

Where:
- **name**: Label key (must start with a letter/number, may contain `-`, `_`, `.`, letters, and numbers)
- **value**: Label value (same character restrictions as the key)

Label keys can be prefixed with an optional domain name followed by a `/`, e.g., `example.com/my-label: value`.

### Adding Labels to Resources

Labels can be added to resources in multiple ways:

#### When Creating a Resource

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    environment: production
    app: nginx
    tier: frontend
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

#### Using kubectl

```bash
# Add labels to a new resource
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --labels="environment=production,app=nginx"

# Add or update labels for existing resources
kubectl label pods nginx environment=production app=nginx

# Overwrite an existing label
kubectl label --overwrite pods nginx environment=staging
```

### Common Label Use Cases

1. **Environment Identification**
   ```
   environment: production
   environment: staging
   environment: development
   ```

2. **Application or Service Identification**
   ```
   app: web
   app: api
   app: database
   ```

3. **Version Management**
   ```
   version: v1.0.0
   version: v1.1.0
   version: latest
   ```

4. **Tier or Layer**
   ```
   tier: frontend
   tier: backend
   tier: cache
   ```

5. **Release Tracking**
   ```
   release: stable
   release: canary
   release: beta
   ```

6. **Team or Owner**
   ```
   team: frontend-dev
   team: backend-dev
   team: ops
   ```

## Selectors

Selectors allow you to identify and select sets of objects based on their labels. Kubernetes supports two types of selectors:

### Equality-Based Selectors

Equality-based selectors use `=`, `==`, or `!=` operators:

```bash
# Select pods with environment=production
kubectl get pods -l environment=production

# Select pods that don't have environment=production
kubectl get pods -l environment!=production
```

### Set-Based Selectors

Set-based selectors use `in`, `notin`, and `exists` operators:

```bash
# Select pods where environment is either production or staging
kubectl get pods -l 'environment in (production,staging)'

# Select pods where environment is neither production nor staging
kubectl get pods -l 'environment notin (production,staging)'

# Select pods that have the environment label (any value)
kubectl get pods -l 'environment'

# Select pods that don't have the environment label
kubectl get pods -l '!environment'
```

### Complex Selectors

You can combine multiple selectors for more precise selection:

```bash
# Select production frontend pods
kubectl get pods -l environment=production,tier=frontend

# Select all frontend pods in either production or staging
kubectl get pods -l 'tier=frontend,environment in (production,staging)'
```

## Using Labels and Selectors in Kubernetes Resources

### Pod Deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
```

In this Deployment:
- The Deployment itself has the label `app: nginx`
- The `selector` field tells the Deployment which pods to manage
- The pod template includes labels that must match the selector

### Service Selection

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
    tier: frontend
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
```

This Service routes traffic to pods with labels `app: nginx` and `tier: frontend`.

### Advanced Selectors with matchExpressions

For more complex selection requirements, use `matchExpressions`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: complex-app
spec:
  selector:
    matchExpressions:
      - {key: environment, operator: In, values: [production, staging]}
      - {key: tier, operator: NotIn, values: [maintenance]}
      - {key: app, operator: Exists}
  # ...
```

This selector matches pods that:
1. Have `environment` set to either `production` or `staging` AND
2. Don't have `tier` set to `maintenance` AND
3. Have the `app` label (with any value)

## Label Selectors vs. Field Selectors

While label selectors filter objects based on their labels, field selectors filter objects based on their fields:

```bash
# Select pods running on a specific node
kubectl get pods --field-selector spec.nodeName=worker-node-1

# Select services with a specific clusterIP
kubectl get services --field-selector spec.clusterIP=10.96.0.1
```

Field selectors are less commonly used than label selectors.

## Node Selectors and Affinity

### Node Selector

Schedule pods on nodes with specific labels:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: gpu-pod
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    hardware: high-memory
  containers:
  - name: gpu-container
    image: gpu-app
```

This schedules the pod only on nodes labeled with `hardware: high-memory`.

### Node Affinity

More flexible than nodeSelector for complex node selection:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: gpu-pod
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: hardware
            operator: In
            values:
            - high-memory
            - ultra-memory
  containers:
  - name: gpu-container
    image: gpu-app
```

## Best Practices for Labels

1. **Use meaningful labels**: Choose labels that clearly describe resource characteristics
2. **Be consistent**: Use the same labeling conventions across all resources
3. **Don't use too many labels**: Focus on important classifications
4. **Plan your label schema**: Create a labeling strategy for your organization
5. **Avoid service-coupled labels**: Don't tie labels to specific services that might change
6. **Use recommended labels**: Consider using Kubernetes recommended labels like:
   ```
   app.kubernetes.io/name: mysql
   app.kubernetes.io/instance: mysql-abcxzy
   app.kubernetes.io/version: "5.7.21"
   app.kubernetes.io/component: database
   app.kubernetes.io/part-of: wordpress
   app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: helm
   ```

## Label and Selector Examples for Common Scenarios

### Blue-Green Deployments

```yaml
# Blue deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-blue
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
      version: blue
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
        version: blue
    spec:
      # ...

# Green deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-green
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
      version: green
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
        version: green
    spec:
      # ...

# Service initially pointing to blue
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
    version: blue
  ports:
  - port: 80
```

To switch traffic to green, update the service selector:
```bash
kubectl patch service my-app -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"green"}}}'
```

### Canary Deployment

```yaml
# Main deployment (90% of traffic)
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-stable
spec:
  replicas: 9
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
      version: stable
  # ...

# Canary deployment (10% of traffic)
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-canary
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
      version: canary
  # ...

# Service sending traffic to both
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app  # Matches both versions
  ports:
  - port: 80
```

## Example CKAD Tasks

### Task 1: Select Pods with Multiple Criteria

**Task**: List all pods that have the label `environment=production` and `tier=frontend`.

**Solution**:
```bash
kubectl get pods -l environment=production,tier=frontend
```

### Task 2: Update Deployment to Target Different Pods

**Task**: Update a service named `web-service` to target pods with the label `version=v2` instead of `version=v1`.

**Solution**:
```bash
kubectl patch service web-service -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"v2"}}}'
```

### Task 3: Label Nodes and Schedule Pods

**Task**: 
1. Label a node named `worker-1` with `disk=ssd`
2. Create a pod that will be scheduled only on nodes with the `disk=ssd` label

**Solution**:
```bash
# Step 1: Label the node
kubectl label nodes worker-1 disk=ssd

# Step 2: Create a pod with nodeSelector
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: fast-storage-app
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    disk: ssd
  containers:
  - name: main-app
    image: nginx
EOF
```
